Hello, I am Karoline Bitencourt! Glad to know you've reached here!

I have a bachelor degree in Control and Automation Engineering, from which I could learn a lot! As much as I love studying, I decided to pursue my passion, which is Computer Science! One of my favorite activities is programming. At the moment I am immersing myself in Python so I can start being a true programmer! What do I do at the moment? I work at my dream company's as an intern.

In my personal life, I love oriental culture, such countries as China and Japan. Besides studying English, I am taking my initial steps in Japanese Language. My biggest goal in life is being a little bit better than I was yesterday, so I will be able to accomplish my biggest personal goal in life, which is helping others the best way I can. As much as we teach, it is as much as we learn, maybe a little more. Living each day as the best of my life, even if it means it is the worst, turning disadvantages into opportunities, of course, to learn! Even if we can't do our best today, if it is possible, we can try again tomorrow. The sun shines for everybody;
